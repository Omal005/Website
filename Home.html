            <p> Today there are 250 species of turtles on earth. Seven of these live in the ocean and are called sea turtles. The remaining 243 species live on land or in freshwater ponds and marshes. The terrestrial turtles, those that live solely on land, are called tortoises.
            <br><br>
             Sea turtles spend most of their lives in the water. Throughout their lifetimes, some species cross entire ocean basins. Adult females come ashore once a year to build a nest and lay their eggs. Males, however, may not leave the ocean at all after hatching.
            For that very reason, it is difficult for scientists to study these marine animals. Much of today's knowledge is derived from analyzing and tagging females when they climb out of the water for nesting. Based upon the declining numbers of nesting females, sea turtle populations are estimated to be at significant risk of extinction.
            <br><br>
            With five of the seven sea turtle species being regularly found along the coast of Sri Lanka, there is no better place to volunteer to ensure these amazing animals have the best chance of survival. Although the nesting season is at its peak from November to May, there are turtles coming ashore regularly all year round. Sea turtles play an important cultural role for many coastal communities around the world. Many indigenous cultures revere them or consider them ancestors. They are also an important source of income for coastal residents through turtle-watching ecotourism which is a major and an increasingly popular part of Sri Lanka tourism. Research has shown that sea turtle ecotourism can generate three times the income, than by selling sea turtle parts (eggs, meat and shells), making them worth more alive than dead.

        <h2>What can we do to save sea turtles of Sri Lanka?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce marine debris that may entangle or be accidentally eaten by sea turtles.</li>
            <li>Participate in coastal clean-ups and reduce plastic use to keep our beaches and ocean clean. The trash in the ocean can harm sea turtles and other creatures that live there.</li>
            <li>Carry reusable water bottles and shopping bags. Refrain from releasing balloons, they'll likely end up in the ocean where sea turtles can mistake them for prey and consume them.</li>
            <li>Keep nesting beaches dark and safe for sea turtles. Turn off, shield, or redirect lights visible from the beach. Lights disorient hatchling sea turtles and discourage nesting females from coming onto the beach to lay their eggs.</li>
            <li>Do not disturb nesting turtles, nests, or hatchlings. Attend organised sea turtle watches that know how to safely observe nesting sea turtles.</li>
            <li>Remove recreational beach equipment like chairs, umbrellas, boats at night - so that sea turtles are not turned away.</li>
        </ul>
