                    <p>Hikkaduwa's name is believed to have been created from a mix of two words, Ship Kaduwa, which refers to Knowledge and Sword in short, which in turn inspires the name of the resort town implying Sword of Knowledge.

With a high-performance wave and an A-frame peak which has a considerable line running through to the shore, with a left break into a channel with the choicest mix of sand and reef, the main reef at Hikkaduwa is mostly crowded in favorable conditions.
