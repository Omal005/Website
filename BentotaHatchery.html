                <p>The hatchery aims to protect and conserve sea turtles by providing a safe environment for their nesting, hatching, and rehabilitation. It also focuses on raising awareness about the importance of sea turtle conservation among the local community and visitors.</p>

               <img src="./turtle nesting.png" alt="">
               <ul>
                <li>Sri Lanka is known for its turtle conservation efforts, and several species of turtle can be found nesting along the Sri Lankan coastline. These beaches are protected and monitored by local communities, conservation organizations, and government agencies.</li>
                <li>Sri Lanka's nesting season occurs between November and April, and several measures are implemented to protect the nesting turtles and their eggs.</li>
                <li>Sri Lanka is implementing measures to protect endangered turtle species, preserve nesting habitats, and raise awareness about the importance of biodiversity conservation.</li>

               <h1>Hatching</h1>
               <img src="./turtle hatching.jpg" alt="">
               <ul>
                <li>In Sri Lanka, turtle eggs are laid on nesting beaches and undergo a period of incubation before the hatchlings emerge. The nests are carefully marked and monitored by local volunteers, conservation organizations, or trained individuals.</li>
                <li>To safeguard the nests, protective measures are implemented, such as mesh screens and cages, to prevent predation by animals and human interference.</li>
                <li>When the time comes for the hatchlings to emerge, the nests are carefully observed, and artificial lights that may confuse the hatchlings are shielded or redirected.</li>
                <li>Once the hatchlings start to emerge from their nests, trained volunteers gently guide them towards the ocean, ensuring they have the best chance of survival.</li>
               </ul>
               <br>

               <h1>Educational programs</h1>
               <img src="./sea turtle education.jpg" alt="">
               <ul>
                <li>Sri Lanka conducts educational programs about sea turtles to promote conservation efforts and raise awareness among local communities, tourists, and schoolchildren. These programs involve distributing educational materials, such as brochures, posters, and leaflets, highlighting key information about sea turtles.</li>
                <li>Sea turtle conservation projects in Sri Lanka have visitor centers that provide in-depth information about sea turtles and their conservation.</li>
                <li>Guided turtle watching programs allow participants to witness the nesting process and gain a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by sea turtles.</li>
                <li>Schools across coastal regions host sea turtle educational programs that engage students in interactive activities.</li>
               </ul>
